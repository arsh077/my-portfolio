## 📁 Correct File Structure

After adding your photo, you should have:
```
your-project/
├── public/
│   ├── profile-red-bg.jpg     ← Your actual photo here
│   ├── profile-striped-shirt.jpg
│   ├── favicon.svg

├── App.tsx
└── ...
```

## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

### Success Signs:
- ✅ Your red background photo appears in the hero section
- ✅ Photo scales up when you hover over it
- ✅ No broken image icon
- ✅ Photo loads immediately when you refresh

### If It's Not Working:
1. **Check filename**: Must be exactly `profile-red-bg.jpg`
2. **Check location**: Must be in the `public` folder
3. **Refresh browser**: Press Ctrl+F5 (hard refresh)
4. **Check file size**: Should be under 2MB

## 🎨 What You'll See

Once your photo is added:
